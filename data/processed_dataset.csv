How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"I mean realistically we all knew he was in the Epstein files. 

But all I'm getting out of this is that Elon KNEW he was in the files, yet still happily wore ""Trump was right about everything"" hats and paraded around calling him wonderful and perfect.  He obviously doesn't care about Epstein or pedophiles like he claims, it's all political theatre.

This is as much a self-own as a dig at Trump. He's admitting he knew and just didn't care.  He thinks he's owning Trump, but we all already knew this information.  The only person looking bad person coming off the worst here (edited to fix a bad choice of words, Musk isn't the ONLY one who looks bad) here is Musk for having absolutely no morals and hiding/ignoring the info while Trump was useful to him.

Edit to clarify: Of course Trump looks awful in this as well, and Epstein is obviously a piece of shit. What I mean is that the only truly ""new"" information here is that Musk knew and is telling on himself.",r/AskReddit,Human,205.0,9.0,3.8390243902439023,30.0
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"There’s already video of Trump being at a party surrounded by women telling a joke to Epstein. We know they were connected. There’s more credible assault allegations against Trump than I can remember. There’s nothing new here. Also, the Epstein “files” are kind of a mythical construct. There’s plenty of real stuff released pertaining to the matter, and plenty more that is probably sealed away for good, but what are the “files” supposed to be, anyway? Like one little black book that just lays out in serial order every client of his and which exact sexual crimes each one committed? I don’t think it works that way.

Bottom line: nothing new here, except it’s very funny to hear Elon admit he spent $300 million to elect a guy he know was a sex criminal, given how quick Elon is to accuse every critic of his of being a pedo",r/AskReddit,Human,181.0,9.0,3.751381215469613,16.0
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"Steven Fucking Hawking flew on Epstein’s jet to Epstein‘s island. Being in ‘the Epstein files’ doesn’t mean shit. What does mean something is that:

- Trump was a close friend of Epstein’s while openly admitting that he knew Epstein was a pedo;

- Trump’s first wife testified under oath that he violently assaulted then raped her;

- Trump spied on underage and of age contestants in his beauty pageants;

- Trump clearly wants to fuck his own daughter and has wanted to do so since she was a young teen;

- Trump has sexually assaulted dozens of women and bragged about it on tape;

- Trump bragged to his friend (AJ Benza) that he engaged in debaucherous sex with ‘amoral girls’ in Moscow;

- Trump cheated on all his wives;

- Trump blew chunks of Adderall out of his nose on live Tv while he was president of the fucking United States;

- Trump knows all too well that the real reason the Epstein files have not been released is that Epstein blackmailed powerful people by entrapping them for child-rape on behalf of the Israeli and US intelligence agencies (even Obama knows this);

-Etc.

Did Trump rape children with Epstein? IDK. I doubt Musk does either (although Putin likely shared his evidence of Trump’s sexual debauchery in Moscow with Musk). Trump was accused in a civil trial of raping a minor at Epstein’s NYC apartment, but that never got sorted out under the law. As stated, he certainly knew he was a pedo while remaining friends with him. He also hired the guy (Alex Acosta) that clearly let Epstein of the hook the first go around at the behest of the CIA.

Getting distracted by Musk’s impotent accusations is counterproductive.

How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"I don't think there is a conspiracy there.

The other three factors aside from that fuckery is, they should not have let up on the ""weird"" and ""couch fucking"" attacks, Biden stayed in way too long, and they let the Dem establishment dictate what their message should be.

How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"The most recent modern invocation of the Insurrection Act took place in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush used it in an attempt to quell the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. On May 1, federal troops were deployed with local police and sheriffs to maintain order, but the differences between military and police training soon became apparent. In one notorious incident, the Marines and police were called to respond to a domestic disturbance at a local home. When the officers arrived, the inhabitants fired a shotgun through the front door. A policeman yelled “cover me,” meaning hold your fire but prepare to shoot as necessary. The Marines, however, “responded instantly in the way they had been trained, where ‘cover me’ means ‘provide me with cover using firepower.’” The soldiers then opened fire on the residence, shooting more than 200 bullets into the front of the house. Three children were inside the home at the time. No one involved in the incident was killed, but federal troops were pulled out of Los Angeles on May 10, just days after their initial deployment. This incident illustrates the enormous safety risks posed by deploying combat-trained troops to a civilian environment. One miscommunication could have ended civilians’ lives, children’s lives. The fact that none of the bullets hit any of the individuals involved is a matter of pure luck.",r/AskReddit,Human,262.0,12.0,4.370229007633588,28.0
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"It's surreal watching States Rights get violated so brazenly. California did not ask for the US National Guard, nor the US Marines to be deployed. Which means, in my opinion, that this is America attacking one of its own States, California.

It's well documented that California is a primarily seated Democratic Party State. Republicans hate the State just on that fact alone and that it costs them a lot of seats in the Federal Branches of Government. If Republicans could 'attack and take over' the State, like they seem to be right now... then they could remove anyone in power there and likely replace them with one of their own.

It's all a bold move, and I guess we'll see how it plays out. But I feel extremely worried about America. This wouldn't even be happening if ICE was held responsible and conducted their business legally and out in the open, and people's right weren't being violated. It's obvious that the Proud Boys are all working for ICE now, all across the Nation.

How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"Actual Angeleno here. I live less than five miles away from the detention center that the protests started at and are still centered around.

There are definitely a lot more cops on the street and maybe an extra helicopter in the sky compared to normal...but otherwise, everything is normal. There's a reason why most of the news media is showing the same few blocks over and over again in their riot footage, and so much of it is from previous days. The protests are still peaceful.

This deployment of troops is not at all necessary. It's the Trump administration itching for a reaction or an escalation -- anything to distract from the news elsewhere in the world and from Trump's own recent failures.

So as an Angeleno? Stop talking about us. Locals have largely sided with the ""don't give them what they want"" tactic and protesting peacefully.

But I do think it's worth acknowledging that that was a single event that spanned about 4 hours and was only out of control/violent for two. The national guard actually was mobilized by the governor of Virginia about an hour into it, even though it was without federal approval, and an hour after that Trump issued an official statement asking people to go home. Then 15 minutes later Secretary Miller conveniently officially authorized the deployment of the National Guard.

How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"To be precise, it's a little more complicated than that.

The Insurrection Act is an explicit exception to the Posse comitatus act. It says that the military can be deployed domestically in times of insurrection or General Public disorder.

However, it says that the military can only be used at the request of a state government or if there is a finding that the state is unwilling or unable to maintain order on its own.

The last time the US military was deployed without the explicit request of a state government was the Central High crisis of 1957 where the military was deployed to Arkansas to quell protests over integrating schools.

George W bush contemplated deploying the National Guard to New Orleans during katrina, But ultimately declined to do so because the governor of Louisiana had not requested it and he knew it would be controversial.

Trump attempted to order the military to be deployed to stop Washington DC protests during his first term, but the military told him that he could not because it had not been requested by the Washington DC government.

Per a press release at least California has filed a lawsuit asking that the order to deploy the military absent the request of the California state government is unlawful",r/AskReddit,Human,225.0,8.0,4.573333333333333,12.0
"What's your ""I can't believe other people don't know this"" hack?","Chemical hot packs (like Hot Hands hand warmers or Thermacare heat patches) are rated for a specific number of hours of heat. I believe the hand warmers are 10 hours and the larger Thermacare patches are 16.

The way these packs work is by a chemical reaction with oxygen. Which means you get 10 hours of heat for 10 hours of oxygen exposure but they don't have to be 10 consecutive hours.

If you only need them for a few hours, stick them in a zip-lock bag when you're done. They will cool off almost instantly and you still get several more hours of heat. You don't have to throw them away just because you don't need them right now.

When combined and most of the clumps are gone (a whisk helps) then add your noodles and mix. Makes for better consistency and coverage.

When getting out of the shower, use your hands to squeegee yourself dry and flick water off before getting out. You dry off quicker and don't end up with a soaking wet towel.

When reheating things in the microwave, put a small amount of water in a cup or dish along with the food. The water evaporates and prevents drying out, and also absorbs some of the energy so your food doesn't end up with scalding hot and still cold spots. Works great for pizza too.

Turning your A/C on (with heat) will defrost your windshield faster. All air conditioning does is remove moisture from the air.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","This is one of those things that I didn’t expect to be worthwhile, but it was. You actually can save a solid chunk of money—if you use the right tool like this one. I ended up saving over $1,500/year, but I also insure four cars.

I tested several comparison tools and while some of them ended up spamming me with junk, there were a couple like Coverage.com and these alternatives that I now recommend to my friend.

Most insurance companies quietly raise your rate year after year. Nothing major, just enough that you don’t notice. They’re banking on you not shopping around—and to be honest, I didn’t. It always sounded like a hassle. Dozens of tabs, endless forms, phone calls I didn’t want to take.

But recently I decided to check so I used this quote tool, which compares everything in one place. It took maybe 2 minutes, tops. I just answered a few questions and it pulled up offers from multiple big-name providers, side by side. Prices, coverage details, even customer reviews—all laid out in a way that made the choice pretty obvious.

They claimed I could save over $1,000 per year. I ended up exceeding that number and I cut my monthly premium by over $100. That’s over $1200 a year. For the exact same coverage.

No phone tag. No junk emails. Just a better deal in less time than it takes to make coffee. Here’s the link to two comparison sites - the one I used and an alternative that I also tested.

I don't , I have a lead foot and we like to go on rides, long rides, all these things would drive my rates even higher.

I have 0 deductible on comp, $50 deductible on collision, free window replacement, and roadside assistance, also I have rental insurance that is pretty much last as long as I need it if my car is in the shop.

Contrary to what advertising would have us believe, no insurance company can offer a $400+ annual savings while offering the same dollar coverages and the same risk/loss coverage as other companies.

And he piled on every insult and sneer at the disgrace of the affair.

The Zen Master only said: ”Oh, is that so?” and took the baby up into his arms.

Thereafter, during rainy days and stormy nights, he would go out to beg milk from the neighbouring houses. Wherever he went he took the baby, wrapped in the sleeve of his ragged robe.

Now he, who had been regarded as a living Buddha, worshipped as a Shakyamuni, had fallen indeed. Many of the disciples, who had flocked to him, turned against him and left him. The Master still said not a word.

Meantime, the mother found she could not bear the agony of separation from her child and, further, began to be afraid of the consequences in the next life of what she had done. She confessed the name of the real father of the child.

Her own father, rigid in his conception of virtue, became almost mad with fear. He rushed to Hakuin and prostrated himself, begging over and over again for forgiveness. The Zen Master this time too said only: ”Oh, is that so?” and gave him the child back.",Quora,Human,348.0,16.0,3.6724137931034484,47.0
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"No more than anything else.

All forums, virtual or real, pass through three major phases:

Youth: A joyous beginning with like-minded individuals sharing delight in and commitment to a new-found experience.
Maturity: A boom as the masses (or at least others) join. The early joiners often reminisce about the first phase being a “golden age.”
Decline: A long slow decline into chaos due to corruption, or a fading away to eventual silence when all the things to say have been said.
I've been on — and sometimes owned and run — Internet and online forums since the 1980s. They all go through this, no matter the size, scope, topic, structure, or approach.

All.

Perhaps it is a human thing, an inevitable characteristic of all social groups: they have a natural and unavoidable lifespan. Youth, maturity, decline, and death.",Quora,Human,169.0,9.0,4.047337278106509,32.0
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"Quora was ruined long before artificial intelligence. They’d been grasping at straws for years. The entire thing has been limping along, waiting for them to finally pull the plug.

Does AI accelerate it? Maybe. The Q&A format is fundamentally limited. People ask big, sweeping questions early on, and it gradually becomes more and more obscure. AI is perfectly content to answer “Is evolution real?” for the nine trillionth time; the people have long since gotten bored.

So instead it filled up the empty spaces with spammers, trolls, and children copypasting their homework. And, weirdly, with Quora’s own “AI” spewing out questions, trying to fill the gap.

So yeah, Quora is worse for people copypasting answers from ChatGPT. But even before that, they’d been copypasting from web sites before that; it was just slightly easier to spot it as plagiarism. It’s different-bad, but not necessarily worse. It hasn’t ruined anything that wasn’t already ruined.",Quora,Human,199.0,14.0,4.035175879396985,30.0
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"That's a very flawed way of viewing the demise of Quora. If anything, it gives too much credit to AI. It's not that AI ruined Quora but more that Quora allowed AI loose into areas it shouldn't have and that worsened many of the fundamental cracks in the foundation.

Quora has always been very AI-forward and one of the biggest evangelists for the use of AI. They were very open about the use of AI to learn from the Quora Partner Program and the later use of Poe to answer Quora questions. AI itself is a phenomenal creative tool and in many ways, a powerful force in the Q&A world.

Where Quora went wrong has been to go fully AI. One AI generated question about what we think of the Roman Empire followed by an AI generated answer is fine. 5000 questions about what we think of the Roman Empire answered by 5000 AI generated bots is terrible. 5000 question and answers asked about the Roman Empire every day is just a waste of everyone's time and resources.

The Quora product effectively trained the algorithms to drive traffic by flooding the plains with nonsense. AI is most effective when it is complemented with reinforced learning with human feedback. It is a well known fact that zero-shot prompting is the most inefficient and ineffective use of generative AI. Yes, some of that is countered through upvoting and views but so much of the human interactions and context generation tools have been stripped from Quora with the guide of feeding the algorithm, it's allowed for the hallucinations to take over.

AI isn't to blame for Quora's drop in quality. It's the fact that Quora decided to bend into AI that is to blame.",Quora,Human,321.0,16.0,4.168224299065421,31.0
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"It’s pretty obvious that quora has a strange culture of know-it-alls trying to show off, but this AI product makes it clear that the act of showing off is the product. The answers are garbage and they obviously don’t care. The key action for sale is not finding an answer, but writing it.

What’s really interesting is that Quora product team decided they wanted to juice engagement with fake AI created posts, and real humans are complying to answer them. Questions that make no sense, and no human asked. Quora is proving (again) that people will engage in parasocial behavior with LLMs. We’ve seen AI girlfriends and companions, we’ve seen tutors, and knowledge assistants. This is the opportunity to brag - artificial students (likely cut from the same API as those tutors).

I can only assume that question-answering-users are the real market they advertise to, profitably. This would imply that this strategy is profitable or could be profitable for them. The nice thing about this compared to more personalized LLM companions like AI girlfriends is that the inference costs can be distributed across all users by sharing the questions. I would posit that there exists an opportunity to make a Twitter or Reddit clone that explicitly intermixed bots. Maybe even exclusively bots. People want to talk on the internet and told they’re special. The interaction doesn’t need to be organic.

Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"No! Why would the device every writer, buisnessman, avid gamer, graphic designer, 3d modeller, software engineer, DJ, electronic musician, and internet user relies on become obsolete? (Note: I count Mac products as PCs.) People used to think we would forsake computers for mobile devices. Little did they realize, tablets are less powerful, have a smaller battery, and don’t have a keyboard making them unwanted for people who are serious about tasks.

See, mobile devices will always be behind computers for one fundamental reason: space. We’ve gotten pretty good at compacting the parts of a desktop into a laptop, but laptops are much bigger than tablets granting them an advantage. The more space you have, the bigger the battery you can have and thus a higher wattage. The more watts you can pump through your device, the more powerful it is. A desktop Intel i7 draws significantly more power than, say, an Intel Pentium to run at factory speed. That brings up another drawback to mobile devices: cooling.

A CPU cooler requires a thicker frame to fit than, say, an iPad. If you’ll notice, there are no fans in mobile devices for this reason. However, laptops do have fans in the form of CPU cooling units which are heat-conductive plates over the CPU with a fan duct cooling it off. While we are getting better and better at creating low-heat processors, this will always be another hurtle that mobile devices must overcome.

The third flaw with mobile devices is the lack of a keyboard. Keyboards are essential for people wishing to type quickly. Not only are they much more finger-convenient than a touch screen but they provide a tactile bounce when pressed. This bounce boosts your fingers as you type allowing you to achieve a much higher WPM on a keyboard. While certain platforms like Microsoft Surface attempted to market a “tablet” PC with a detachable keyboard, not many people bought them as a need never appeared to remove the keyboard for users. Thus, people who are very price-cautious like me question whether a detachable keyboard is even worth the money resulting in the product to sell minimally.

So when it comes down to it, not only has the interface of a PC proven itself time and time again, laptops and desktops will always be significantly more powerful than tablets and phones due to a larger space for a higher-wattage battery and a cooled CPU. Original question: “Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?”",Quora,Human,479.0,23.0,4.22964509394572,60.0
Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"It depends mostly on the answers to the following three questions:

What is the computer used for?
How much capacity you can add to the computer by upgrading components?
How much computing power does it need to run the latest version of the operating system you are using?
Generally, the lighter the tasks you use the computer for, the longer its use can be extended before it becomes obsolete. Light usage such as web surfing, writing emails and editing documents in Word or Excel can all still be done comfortably on a machine with an Intel Core 2 processer that is more than 10 years old (at the time of this writing) and running Windows 7. If the components in the computer such as RAM and CPU have been upgraded to their full capacity and other performance improvements such as replacing old hard drives with SSDs are made, such a computer might even be able to run Windows 10 quite acceptably. For example, I have an old Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop which I purchased in 2010. Over the years, I have upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, replaced the CPU with an Intel T9900 and installed an SSD. It is by modern standards still a slow machine however it is able to easily run Windows 10 and works quite well for light usage tasks such as the ones I have mentioned above. Obviously, for heavy tasks such as high-end gaming, video production or 3D animation, it is an obsolete machine however since I don’t do any of these tasks the computer is still of some use to me. Older Pentium based computers dating back to 1993 can probably be considered obsolete since they cannot run any recent versions of Windows regardless of upgrades. However, even so, they can still run operating systems with lighter system requirements such as lightweight Linux distributions. The first PC I ever owned (an Intel 386 machine) is definitely now well and truly obsolete as a computing device.",Quora,Human,366.0,13.0,4.2076502732240435,31.0
Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"Shit yes. My personal computer is obsolete right now.

Maybe you mean, Will local computers become obsolete?

Well, there’s a race going on, between the power of servers on one hand, and the power of desktops and phones on the other hand, and also with the speed of the average network connection.

When servers become much more powerful, computation moves to the server. When data becomes voluminous, computation moves to the local node. It’s been a seesaw battle for maybe 50 years now, with no long-term winner evident.

There will always be some kind of local node, to render the user interface (screen, keyboard, voice, direct neural stimulation, whatever). It seems reasonable that there will always be some kind of server node in the cloud, as long as connections are quick. But the first explorers on Titan will need to take their servers with ‘em, because that 50 minute delay makes games really laggy.",Quora,Human,186.0,10.0,4.053763440860215,28.0

And that will be a desktop.

To get red of desktops we would need to redefine concept of computer itself and turn it into something completely different compared to what it currently is.

Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"Computer circuitry has become too integrated into normal domestic appliances and TVs, DVRs, PVRs have all become too computer-smart.

The stand-alone PC may become obsolete, and even the alleged “internet terminal” as it now appears on the TV may also fade away.

As voice recognition improves (and still has a long way to go), people are going to take up Home Automation. I have no problem with a computer controlling air-flow and curtains in order to reduce energy consumption, but I don’t need a system that prepares my meals for me.

This level of integration will very likely make what we recognise right now appear to be obsolete, and the closest to a “terminal” to be seen in the home will be a touch screen accompanied by a voice input. All of these integrations will be consumer-oriented, pumping even more advertising into homes.

The keyboard, mouse, box, and screen, arrangement probably will become obsolete, and the keyboard will be an option entirely for the devout, but now that computers have wormed their way (in multiple numbers) into the majority of homes, even in under-developed countries, regardless of form-factor, they’re here to stay.",Quora,Human,227.0,7.0,4.251101321585903,33.0

For me, it’s about challenging systems where one person or group holds all the power, whether that’s in politics, corporations, or even social structures. We’re supposed to live in a democracy, not a hierarchy ruled by influencers and CEOs who act like royalty. I just hope it stays peaceful and that people use it to demand real change instead of turning it into a spectacle.",r/AskReddit,AI,102.0,4.0,3.764705882352941,10.0
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"When I read that 700 Marines are being sent to LA, my stomach dropped a little. It just feels… extreme? Like, this isn’t a warzone — it’s a city where people live, work, go to school. The military showing up in force gives the vibe that things are completely out of control, even if that’s not actually the case. I get that maybe it’s for support or safety or whatever, but it’s hard not to feel like this is a step toward normalizing martial law. And that’s scary.",r/AskReddit,AI,112.0,6.0,3.375,12.0
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"Honestly, it’s wild that we’ve reached a point where sending Marines into a major U.S. city doesn’t even shock people anymore. Whether it’s for protests, riots, or “stabilization,” it feels like a massive overreach. I’m not anti-military, but I am very pro-civilian oversight. And when troops are walking the streets, it’s hard to believe the government sees us as anything other than a threat. That’s not a great feeling.",r/AskReddit,AI,96.0,5.0,3.6875,15.0
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"Part of me wants to think, “Maybe they’re just there to help,” but I’ve seen how these deployments usually go. Intimidation, escalation, confusion. Throwing military into a city doesn’t fix systemic issues — it just hides them under a layer of control. I’d rather see that kind of effort and funding go into education, mental health, or housing. Not boots on the ground. Not again.",r/AskReddit,AI,87.0,6.0,3.6436781609195403,12.0

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","Yes, switching car insurance can absolutely save you money — I’ve done it myself. A lot of providers give huge discounts to new customers that they don’t offer to loyal ones, which feels kind of backwards but that’s the game. I switched last year and saved about $300 annually without changing my coverage. The catch is you’ve got to actually compare policies and read the fine print.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","Honestly, the “save hundreds by switching” thing is partly true and partly marketing exaggeration. It really depends on your driving history, location, and how long you’ve been with your current insurer. Some companies will lowball you at first just to get your business, then slowly raise premiums over time. So yeah, you might save at first, but you have to keep checking rates every year or two.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","For me, switching didn’t save much at all. I spent hours getting quotes and when I finally found a cheaper one, the coverage wasn’t nearly as good.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","It depends how long you’ve been with your current company. Insurance companies use loyalty against you after a while — they assume you won’t leave. I shopped around after five years and my original company dropped their quote by $150 after I told them I was switching. That tells me they could have given me that rate all along.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","The hype part is when they say “save $500 instantly” — that’s not always realistic. But switching can save money, especially if your life situation changed. Moved to a safer area? Better credit score? Newer car with safety features? All of those can qualify you for better rates with a different company.

What is the most unfair thing in our society?,"One of the most unfair things, in my opinion, is how much your zip code affects your entire life. Where you're born determines the quality of your education, access to healthcare, even your life expectancy.
