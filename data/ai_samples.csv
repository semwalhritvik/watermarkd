How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"Honestly curious what people think about this — Elon Musk apparently mentioned that Trump is in the Epstein files. Not sure how much traction this is getting or how credible the sources are, but it definitely caught my attention. The whole Epstein situation has always been murky, with big names floating around but very little legal follow-through. If Musk is calling that out directly, it feels like either he's trying to shift public focus, stir controversy, or maybe just drop truth bombs now that he’s more vocal online. Of course, this could also be a distraction or part of some larger media game. I don’t know where I stand yet — on one hand, it’s not surprising given the people Epstein was connected to, but on the other hand, claims like this can easily spiral into misinformation if not handled carefully. Has anyone seen any confirmed documents or solid reporting on this? Curious where others are landing on this — is it worth digging into more, or just another social media storm?",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"I saw a headline floating around that Elon Musk mentioned Trump being listed in the Epstein files, and I can't tell if it's being taken seriously or just tossed around for drama. It’s wild how casually these huge claims get dropped now — like, if true, that’s massive. But then again, it’s Elon, and he’s known to stir the pot on purpose. The Epstein case has always had this cloud of mystery and elite names circling it, but nothing ever seems to stick publicly. It makes you wonder if this is a legit call-out or just another layer of online chaos. Either way, it's hard to ignore when someone that high-profile throws fuel on a topic that already has conspiracy energy around it. I haven’t seen solid evidence yet, but I’d be interested in any real documents or court listings that back it up. Otherwise, it kind of feels like internet theater.",r/AskReddit,Human
"How do you feel about the ""No Kings"" protest happening tomorrow?","Just heard there’s a “No Kings” protest planned for tomorrow and I’m genuinely curious how people feel about it. The name alone is kind of striking — makes you think about what it's actually pushing back against. Is it more symbolic, like a stand against power imbalances and elitism? Or is there a more specific goal people are rallying around? I’ve seen bits and pieces online but haven’t found a clear summary of what the movement stands for beyond the slogan. On one hand, I get the appeal of challenging concentrated authority, especially when it feels like certain people or institutions operate with zero accountability. On the other hand, I worry that vague protests without a clear mission can get hijacked or misrepresented really fast. Has anyone been following this more closely? Is it more of a social justice statement or just general anti-establishment energy? I’d love to hear from folks who actually support or oppose it and why — not just the hot takes, but what it really means to different people.",r/AskReddit,Human
"How do you feel about the ""No Kings"" protest happening tomorrow?","The “No Kings” protest happening tomorrow has been popping up all over my feed, and I’m still trying to wrap my head around what it’s really aiming for. The phrase itself sounds bold, almost theatrical — like something from a dystopian novel — but I assume it’s a statement about rejecting hierarchy or unchecked authority in modern systems. Some people seem to be treating it as an anti-billionaire or anti-corporate movement, while others are tying it to deeper political frustrations. I’m not entirely sure where I land yet. It’s one of those things where the message feels emotionally powerful, but I’m not clear on what specific change it's demanding. Is it about wealth inequality? Government overreach? Cultural elitism? Maybe all of the above? I do think public protests are a powerful way to get people talking, but if the message is too broad, it risks losing impact. Still, I’ll be keeping an eye on what happens — sometimes these kinds of events spark bigger conversations than expected. Anyone else following this?",r/AskReddit,Human
I accidentally became my sister’s parent. She just made me a Mother’s Day card.,"I never planned for this, but somewhere along the way, I ended up becoming more of a parent to my younger sister than just her sibling. Our parents have always been… emotionally checked out, if I’m being generous. They provide the basics — roof, food, school — but anything beyond that? Support, guidance, just being present? It’s like they’re running on autopilot. So, I started stepping in — helping her with homework, talking her through breakups, making sure she eats when they forget dinner. It didn’t happen overnight, but now she calls me when she’s scared or confused, and looks at me the way I used to look at them when I was little. I’m not even mad about it. I just feel this heavy mix of love and pressure. I’m in my early 20s and barely have myself figured out, but I’m trying to be steady for her. I don’t know if I’m doing it right. I just know she deserves better than what we got. I guess I just needed to let this out somewhere. Thanks for reading.",r/TrueOffMyChest,Human
“I love you?”,"This caught me off guard in the best way today. My kid was doing one of those little school activities — you know, “fill in the blanks about your parents” type things — and one of the questions was, “What does Dad always say?” I expected something silly like “Clean your room” or “Go brush your teeth,” because let’s be real, that’s usually what I’m nagging about. But he said, totally matter-of-fact, “I love you.” And man… that hit me harder than I expected. I try to say it often, but you never really know what sticks with them. Hearing that, knowing that’s what came to his mind first — it just felt like something I must be doing right. It’s not easy being a parent. Most days I feel like I’m winging it and hoping I don’t mess him up too badly. But this… this felt like proof that the love part, at least, is landing. Just wanted to put that out into the world.",r/TrueOffMyChest,Human
