How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"I mean realistically we all knew he was in the Epstein files. 

But all I'm getting out of this is that Elon KNEW he was in the files, yet still happily wore ""Trump was right about everything"" hats and paraded around calling him wonderful and perfect.  He obviously doesn't care about Epstein or pedophiles like he claims, it's all political theatre.

This is as much a self-own as a dig at Trump. He's admitting he knew and just didn't care.  He thinks he's owning Trump, but we all already knew this information.  The only person looking bad person coming off the worst here (edited to fix a bad choice of words, Musk isn't the ONLY one who looks bad) here is Musk for having absolutely no morals and hiding/ignoring the info while Trump was useful to him.

Edit to clarify: Of course Trump looks awful in this as well, and Epstein is obviously a piece of shit. What I mean is that the only truly ""new"" information here is that Musk knew and is telling on himself.",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"There’s already video of Trump being at a party surrounded by women telling a joke to Epstein. We know they were connected. There’s more credible assault allegations against Trump than I can remember. There’s nothing new here. Also, the Epstein “files” are kind of a mythical construct. There’s plenty of real stuff released pertaining to the matter, and plenty more that is probably sealed away for good, but what are the “files” supposed to be, anyway? Like one little black book that just lays out in serial order every client of his and which exact sexual crimes each one committed? I don’t think it works that way.

Bottom line: nothing new here, except it’s very funny to hear Elon admit he spent $300 million to elect a guy he know was a sex criminal, given how quick Elon is to accuse every critic of his of being a pedo",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"Steven Fucking Hawking flew on Epstein’s jet to Epstein‘s island. Being in ‘the Epstein files’ doesn’t mean shit. What does mean something is that:

- Trump was a close friend of Epstein’s while openly admitting that he knew Epstein was a pedo;

- Trump’s first wife testified under oath that he violently assaulted then raped her;

- Trump spied on underage and of age contestants in his beauty pageants;

- Trump clearly wants to fuck his own daughter and has wanted to do so since she was a young teen;

- Trump has sexually assaulted dozens of women and bragged about it on tape;

- Trump bragged to his friend (AJ Benza) that he engaged in debaucherous sex with ‘amoral girls’ in Moscow;

- Trump cheated on all his wives;

- Trump blew chunks of Adderall out of his nose on live Tv while he was president of the fucking United States;

- Trump knows all too well that the real reason the Epstein files have not been released is that Epstein blackmailed powerful people by entrapping them for child-rape on behalf of the Israeli and US intelligence agencies (even Obama knows this);

-Etc.

Did Trump rape children with Epstein? IDK. I doubt Musk does either (although Putin likely shared his evidence of Trump’s sexual debauchery in Moscow with Musk). Trump was accused in a civil trial of raping a minor at Epstein’s NYC apartment, but that never got sorted out under the law. As stated, he certainly knew he was a pedo while remaining friends with him. He also hired the guy (Alex Acosta) that clearly let Epstein of the hook the first go around at the behest of the CIA.

Getting distracted by Musk’s impotent accusations is counterproductive.

BTW Musk is likely also mentioned in government files on Epstein (Kung Fu with Ghislaine?)…",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"I don't think there is a conspiracy there. It's likely their concerted effort to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of votes across the swing states, by changing laws or ""challenging"" ballots worked. There is a gentleman who used FOIA requests and found that Kamala had a very high chance of winning swing states if ballets weren't tossed.

The other three factors aside from that fuckery is, they should not have let up on the ""weird"" and ""couch fucking"" attacks, Biden stayed in way too long, and they let the Dem establishment dictate what their message should be. If their message was populist things like, taxing the rich, putting more money in peoples pockets, healthcare for all, affordable housing, unions, and shoved it down everyone's throat instead of letting them say ""Kamala don't have a plan."" We'd be in better shape.

Thinking about it, it almost feels like the Dem establishment wanted Trump to win, just so they don't have to run on anything of substance for the next however many years this Trump term will live in our heads. They just need to say, ""We're not Trump.""",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"Some time ago, a news outlet got a hold of (and published) Epstein's little black book. This was his address book, There were entries for both the Trumps and the Clintons, but, depending upon one's political stance, only one of those entries seemed to exist. The book was made searchable. It was easy to prove both were there. Each side denied their person was there even after being shown.

Of course Trump is in the Epstein files.

There is a good chance Musk is too. And that goes for most powerful men, regardless of political affiliation. If only one side was implicated, the other would have released the files by now.

"How do you feel about the ""No Kings"" protest happening tomorrow?","The entire time I was growing up (before serving in the military), my father, a Korean War Vet, would make fun of military parades in Russia or China or where ever. He would say, ""Countries that need military parades are pathetic. We don't need military parades because we don't need to show off. That's for dickless authoritarians"". On the occasion of Father's Day weekend, I would love to still have my father alive, but I'm glad he didn't have to see Trump's America. He would be disgusted.",r/AskReddit,Human

"How do you feel about the ""No Kings"" protest happening tomorrow?","Couple of things to think about / bring

Bring water, and drink water, lots of it

Eat before you go

Wear layers, long trousers and a long sleeved top. It can get hot, so be prepared with short sleeves underneath.

You're not there to fight, you're there to protest and support your point of view. You won't chance the minds of any counterprotesters in the moment

There probably won't be any problems, but if there are, run away and help other people if you can. Stay on your feet - it's a lot easier to be kettled if you're sat down.

How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"The most recent modern invocation of the Insurrection Act took place in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush used it in an attempt to quell the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. On May 1, federal troops were deployed with local police and sheriffs to maintain order, but the differences between military and police training soon became apparent. In one notorious incident, the Marines and police were called to respond to a domestic disturbance at a local home. When the officers arrived, the inhabitants fired a shotgun through the front door. A policeman yelled “cover me,” meaning hold your fire but prepare to shoot as necessary. The Marines, however, “responded instantly in the way they had been trained, where ‘cover me’ means ‘provide me with cover using firepower.’” The soldiers then opened fire on the residence, shooting more than 200 bullets into the front of the house. Three children were inside the home at the time. No one involved in the incident was killed, but federal troops were pulled out of Los Angeles on May 10, just days after their initial deployment. This incident illustrates the enormous safety risks posed by deploying combat-trained troops to a civilian environment. One miscommunication could have ended civilians’ lives, children’s lives. The fact that none of the bullets hit any of the individuals involved is a matter of pure luck.",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"It's surreal watching States Rights get violated so brazenly. California did not ask for the US National Guard, nor the US Marines to be deployed. Which means, in my opinion, that this is America attacking one of its own States, California.

It's well documented that California is a primarily seated Democratic Party State. Republicans hate the State just on that fact alone and that it costs them a lot of seats in the Federal Branches of Government. If Republicans could 'attack and take over' the State, like they seem to be right now... then they could remove anyone in power there and likely replace them with one of their own.

It's all a bold move, and I guess we'll see how it plays out. But I feel extremely worried about America. This wouldn't even be happening if ICE was held responsible and conducted their business legally and out in the open, and people's right weren't being violated. It's obvious that the Proud Boys are all working for ICE now, all across the Nation. When you have to hide your face from shame... you know you're not doing a good thing.",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"Actual Angeleno here. I live less than five miles away from the detention center that the protests started at and are still centered around.

There are definitely a lot more cops on the street and maybe an extra helicopter in the sky compared to normal...but otherwise, everything is normal. There's a reason why most of the news media is showing the same few blocks over and over again in their riot footage, and so much of it is from previous days. The protests are still peaceful.

This deployment of troops is not at all necessary. It's the Trump administration itching for a reaction or an escalation -- anything to distract from the news elsewhere in the world and from Trump's own recent failures.

So as an Angeleno? Stop talking about us. Locals have largely sided with the ""don't give them what they want"" tactic and protesting peacefully. The best thing the rest of America can do to help is to also deny Trump what he wants, which is attention on L.A. Instead, talk about all the things Trump is trying to distract everyone from in the first place.",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"I mean the obvious answer is that because it was in the sitting US president's best interest and he's a hypocritical fuckwad.

But I do think it's worth acknowledging that that was a single event that spanned about 4 hours and was only out of control/violent for two. The national guard actually was mobilized by the governor of Virginia about an hour into it, even though it was without federal approval, and an hour after that Trump issued an official statement asking people to go home. Then 15 minutes later Secretary Miller conveniently officially authorized the deployment of the National Guard.

This is a prolonged event that is lasting days.

I'm not saying this to dismiss the observation, I am just seeing it a lot, and I don't want people to rally around something that's really a false equivalence and look like idiots.",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about 700 Marines being deployed to LA?,"To be precise, it's a little more complicated than that.

The Insurrection Act is an explicit exception to the Posse comitatus act. It says that the military can be deployed domestically in times of insurrection or General Public disorder.

However, it says that the military can only be used at the request of a state government or if there is a finding that the state is unwilling or unable to maintain order on its own.

The last time the US military was deployed without the explicit request of a state government was the Central High crisis of 1957 where the military was deployed to Arkansas to quell protests over integrating schools.

George W bush contemplated deploying the National Guard to New Orleans during katrina, But ultimately declined to do so because the governor of Louisiana had not requested it and he knew it would be controversial.

Trump attempted to order the military to be deployed to stop Washington DC protests during his first term, but the military told him that he could not because it had not been requested by the Washington DC government.

Per a press release at least California has filed a lawsuit asking that the order to deploy the military absent the request of the California state government is unlawful",r/AskReddit,Human
"What's your ""I can't believe other people don't know this"" hack?","Chemical hot packs (like Hot Hands hand warmers or Thermacare heat patches) are rated for a specific number of hours of heat. I believe the hand warmers are 10 hours and the larger Thermacare patches are 16.

The way these packs work is by a chemical reaction with oxygen. Which means you get 10 hours of heat for 10 hours of oxygen exposure but they don't have to be 10 consecutive hours.

If you only need them for a few hours, stick them in a zip-lock bag when you're done. They will cool off almost instantly and you still get several more hours of heat. You don't have to throw them away just because you don't need them right now.

Similarly, if your hot packs stop working early, it's almost certainly because they don't have enough oxygen. Take them out of your gloves/pockets/shoes for a moment, and they will warm back up!",r/AskReddit,Human
"What's your ""I can't believe other people don't know this"" hack?","As a dental hygienist: anything is always better than nothing.

You do not have to brush and floss at the same time. Just at some point during the day preferred.

Don't like string floss? Try the picks. Keep them in the shower, in the car, on your nightstand, on the couch.

Don't like floss period? Try a waterpik (the brand is waterpik, they make water flossers. I always recommend waterpik because they are the brand with the research to back them).

Hand held models are good for travel or if they are rechargeable, take into the shower (just fill the tank twice). I prefer models that sit on the counter because they have better pressure control and a larger tank (just fill once).

Other options are toothpicks, proxy brushes/soft picks, rubber tip stimulators. Anything to disrupt plaque and stimulate the gums.

Anything is ALWAYS better than nothing. A shitty brush is better than no brush. Flossing once a week is better than none a week. 👍🏼 And always always just do the best you can. 🩷",r/AskReddit,Human

People just seem to assume or default to terrible service or the inability for things to happen for them.

I've gotten VIP upgrades for concerts, free food, complimentary airport lounge passes, reservations at hard to get places, bill concessions.

It's amazing how rudely most people in a forward facing role are treated. If you approach them and treat them with dignity and respect, often times they will happily extend a courtesy to you.

"What's your ""I can't believe other people don't know this"" hack?","When making boxed mac & cheese, when you drain your noodles, take a bit of pasta water and mix it in the pot with milk & cheese packets. When combined and most of the clumps are gone (a whisk helps) then add your noodles and mix. Makes for better consistency and coverage.

When getting out of the shower, use your hands to squeegee yourself dry and flick water off before getting out. You dry off quicker and don't end up with a soaking wet towel.

When reheating things in the microwave, put a small amount of water in a cup or dish along with the food. The water evaporates and prevents drying out, and also absorbs some of the energy so your food doesn't end up with scalding hot and still cold spots. Works great for pizza too.

Turning your A/C on (with heat) will defrost your windshield faster. All air conditioning does is remove moisture from the air.

Floss>Mouthwash>Brush in that order. Don't rinse your mouth out after brushing or you're removing all the fluoride that normally would absorb into your teeth.

Keep cleaning supplies close to what you use them for. Don't store your kitchen cleaners hidden in the laundry room. Don't store the upstairs bathroom cleaners in a downstairs hall closet.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","This is one of those things that I didn’t expect to be worthwhile, but it was. You actually can save a solid chunk of money—if you use the right tool like this one. I ended up saving over $1,500/year, but I also insure four cars.

I tested several comparison tools and while some of them ended up spamming me with junk, there were a couple like Coverage.com and these alternatives that I now recommend to my friend.

Most insurance companies quietly raise your rate year after year. Nothing major, just enough that you don’t notice. They’re banking on you not shopping around—and to be honest, I didn’t. It always sounded like a hassle. Dozens of tabs, endless forms, phone calls I didn’t want to take.

But recently I decided to check so I used this quote tool, which compares everything in one place. It took maybe 2 minutes, tops. I just answered a few questions and it pulled up offers from multiple big-name providers, side by side. Prices, coverage details, even customer reviews—all laid out in a way that made the choice pretty obvious.

They claimed I could save over $1,000 per year. I ended up exceeding that number and I cut my monthly premium by over $100. That’s over $1200 a year. For the exact same coverage.

No phone tag. No junk emails. Just a better deal in less time than it takes to make coffee. Here’s the link to two comparison sites - the one I used and an alternative that I also tested.

If it’s been a while since you’ve checked your rate, do it. You might be surprised at how much you’re overpaying.",Quora,Human
"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?

That's when I told them cancel my policy or I'll file a suit. They cancelled my policy. Don't let big insurance bully you, I went to the general and found the same benefits under 100/month.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","Actually,it depends, I have been with my current insurance provider , automotive insurance, for 30 years, I have excellent coverage, the minimum deductible you can get, and I spend about 550 a month for 5 vehicles, 2 pickup trucks, a car and 2 motorcycles, I have called around to just about every insurance provider there is and no one can get close to what I pay much less cheaper, the only way to get cheaper is to drop my coverage, lose the low deductible, and put a device in my car that tracks mileage and hard braking, and hard acceleration, things to prove you drive good. I don't , I have a lead foot and we like to go on rides, long rides, all these things would drive my rates even higher. So if you bounce around on a regular basis, it may save you money, and are willing to pay 500, or 1000 dollar deductible every time you hit an animal, or something happens to your car, then you probably will save some.

Just my experience, loyalty benefits outweigh switching all the time.

I have 0 deductible on comp, $50 deductible on collision, free window replacement, and roadside assistance, also I have rental insurance that is pretty much last as long as I need it if my car is in the shop.

All for 550 a month. If any insurance company can beat that. I'll switch.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","Comparison shopping usually does yield savings. The premium is not the whole picture, however.

"Does switching car insurance really save you money, or is that just marketing hype?
","ALL U.S. Insurance companies, their rates and coverages are governed by the laws and Insurance Commissions within each individual State.

Contrary to what advertising would have us believe, no insurance company can offer a $400+ annual savings while offering the same dollar coverages and the same risk/loss coverage as other companies.

One 50/100/50 liability policy does not necessarily cover the same driver or situation as another 50/100/50 liability policy. If you listen closely to the ads they mention two factors:

bundling ( most companies offer discounts for maintaining both auto and home owners policies with the same company)
“those who changed policies”.
Interestingly, I recently researched changing companies from one reputable carrier to another reputable company. While I could save roughly $325/annually by changing insurers on the auto policy, the homeowners premium would be $365 more than my current premium. Yes, I could save $325 on my auto premium, but bundling auto and homeowners with the new company would cost $40 more annually. Moving just the auto policy would increase my premium by more than $475 annually since I would lose my multiply policy discount with both insurers.

Since premiums are based on claims and administrative costs, ask yourself how could a company offer lower premiums to new insureds. The answer is not positive,",Quora,Human
What is the most unfair thing in our society?,"Had to think of this for a bit, and the first thing that really stuck out to me is when:

My friends like to tease me because I like to look at the news often and read about what’s going on the world. Especially at work. If I’m not actively training someone and on my breaks, I’ll sit in the back rooms and browse news stuff on the internet for a bit. Because of this, I see FAR too often stories of soft on crime policies and evil people being released on light bail, not serving time, or other bullshit where it’s crystal clear justice wasn’t served.

For example, as I mentioned in a previous answer of mine, one of my friends recently reported to police that she was repeatedly raped. However, nothing was done about her reports. The rapist is still walking free and she wasn’t taken seriously. From what I hear, cases of sexual abuse aren't taken that seriously in some parts of Arizona, especially under corrupt judges. Supposedly… allegedly… this is partially due to the influx and booming “industry” of child sex trafficking which is major in some border states. Levels of corruption there perhaps. I heard of one case where a mother reported she learned her husband was sexually molesting and abusing two of her daughters as she was work. Once again, the case wasn’t taken seriously.",Quora,Human

Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"No more than anything else.

All forums, virtual or real, pass through three major phases:

Youth: A joyous beginning with like-minded individuals sharing delight in and commitment to a new-found experience.
Maturity: A boom as the masses (or at least others) join. The early joiners often reminisce about the first phase being a “golden age.”
Decline: A long slow decline into chaos due to corruption, or a fading away to eventual silence when all the things to say have been said.
I've been on — and sometimes owned and run — Internet and online forums since the 1980s. They all go through this, no matter the size, scope, topic, structure, or approach.

Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"Quora was ruined long before artificial intelligence. They’d been grasping at straws for years. The entire thing has been limping along, waiting for them to finally pull the plug.

Does AI accelerate it? Maybe. The Q&A format is fundamentally limited. People ask big, sweeping questions early on, and it gradually becomes more and more obscure. AI is perfectly content to answer “Is evolution real?” for the nine trillionth time; the people have long since gotten bored.

So instead it filled up the empty spaces with spammers, trolls, and children copypasting their homework. And, weirdly, with Quora’s own “AI” spewing out questions, trying to fill the gap.

So yeah, Quora is worse for people copypasting answers from ChatGPT. But even before that, they’d been copypasting from web sites before that; it was just slightly easier to spot it as plagiarism. It’s different-bad, but not necessarily worse. It hasn’t ruined anything that wasn’t already ruined.",Quora,Human
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"That's a very flawed way of viewing the demise of Quora. If anything, it gives too much credit to AI. It's not that AI ruined Quora but more that Quora allowed AI loose into areas it shouldn't have and that worsened many of the fundamental cracks in the foundation.

Quora has always been very AI-forward and one of the biggest evangelists for the use of AI. They were very open about the use of AI to learn from the Quora Partner Program and the later use of Poe to answer Quora questions. AI itself is a phenomenal creative tool and in many ways, a powerful force in the Q&A world.

Where Quora went wrong has been to go fully AI. One AI generated question about what we think of the Roman Empire followed by an AI generated answer is fine. 5000 questions about what we think of the Roman Empire answered by 5000 AI generated bots is terrible. 5000 question and answers asked about the Roman Empire every day is just a waste of everyone's time and resources.

The Quora product effectively trained the algorithms to drive traffic by flooding the plains with nonsense. AI is most effective when it is complemented with reinforced learning with human feedback. It is a well known fact that zero-shot prompting is the most inefficient and ineffective use of generative AI. Yes, some of that is countered through upvoting and views but so much of the human interactions and context generation tools have been stripped from Quora with the guide of feeding the algorithm, it's allowed for the hallucinations to take over.

AI isn't to blame for Quora's drop in quality. It's the fact that Quora decided to bend into AI that is to blame.",Quora,Human
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"It’s pretty obvious that quora has a strange culture of know-it-alls trying to show off, but this AI product makes it clear that the act of showing off is the product. The answers are garbage and they obviously don’t care. The key action for sale is not finding an answer, but writing it.

What’s really interesting is that Quora product team decided they wanted to juice engagement with fake AI created posts, and real humans are complying to answer them. Questions that make no sense, and no human asked. Quora is proving (again) that people will engage in parasocial behavior with LLMs. We’ve seen AI girlfriends and companions, we’ve seen tutors, and knowledge assistants. This is the opportunity to brag - artificial students (likely cut from the same API as those tutors).

I can only assume that question-answering-users are the real market they advertise to, profitably. This would imply that this strategy is profitable or could be profitable for them. The nice thing about this compared to more personalized LLM companions like AI girlfriends is that the inference costs can be distributed across all users by sharing the questions. I would posit that there exists an opportunity to make a Twitter or Reddit clone that explicitly intermixed bots. Maybe even exclusively bots. People want to talk on the internet and told they’re special. The interaction doesn’t need to be organic.

For proof, look at all the top-level comments on this HN post with no engagement, by users who have repeated the same pattern discussed about quora.",Quora,Human
Is artificial intelligence ruining Quora?,"People feel AI is more reliable source these days, and all are rushing towards it.

Truth to to told OUT LOUD! - AI data cannot be trusted and definately not reliable. AI is a tool, run on alogorithms and machine learning.

AI learns the data from across the web and then shares you the information. And while doing this, is AI learning from the reliable and correct source? No guanrantee on this, right? Think about it again, are all the information available on web all true? No, right?

AI is simply not the solution to your every answer. And YES, AI has ruined Quora answers. I don’t even bother looking into AI answers on Quora. More over, due to this AI implementation, the authencity of Quora answers has gone down. Escpecially, when the actual answers are being hid due to AI bot answers.

Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"No! Why would the device every writer, buisnessman, avid gamer, graphic designer, 3d modeller, software engineer, DJ, electronic musician, and internet user relies on become obsolete? (Note: I count Mac products as PCs.) People used to think we would forsake computers for mobile devices. Little did they realize, tablets are less powerful, have a smaller battery, and don’t have a keyboard making them unwanted for people who are serious about tasks.

See, mobile devices will always be behind computers for one fundamental reason: space. We’ve gotten pretty good at compacting the parts of a desktop into a laptop, but laptops are much bigger than tablets granting them an advantage. The more space you have, the bigger the battery you can have and thus a higher wattage. The more watts you can pump through your device, the more powerful it is. A desktop Intel i7 draws significantly more power than, say, an Intel Pentium to run at factory speed. That brings up another drawback to mobile devices: cooling.

A CPU cooler requires a thicker frame to fit than, say, an iPad. If you’ll notice, there are no fans in mobile devices for this reason. However, laptops do have fans in the form of CPU cooling units which are heat-conductive plates over the CPU with a fan duct cooling it off. While we are getting better and better at creating low-heat processors, this will always be another hurtle that mobile devices must overcome.

The third flaw with mobile devices is the lack of a keyboard. Keyboards are essential for people wishing to type quickly. Not only are they much more finger-convenient than a touch screen but they provide a tactile bounce when pressed. This bounce boosts your fingers as you type allowing you to achieve a much higher WPM on a keyboard. While certain platforms like Microsoft Surface attempted to market a “tablet” PC with a detachable keyboard, not many people bought them as a need never appeared to remove the keyboard for users. Thus, people who are very price-cautious like me question whether a detachable keyboard is even worth the money resulting in the product to sell minimally.

So when it comes down to it, not only has the interface of a PC proven itself time and time again, laptops and desktops will always be significantly more powerful than tablets and phones due to a larger space for a higher-wattage battery and a cooled CPU. Original question: “Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?”",Quora,Human
Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"It depends mostly on the answers to the following three questions:

What is the computer used for?
How much capacity you can add to the computer by upgrading components?
How much computing power does it need to run the latest version of the operating system you are using?
Generally, the lighter the tasks you use the computer for, the longer its use can be extended before it becomes obsolete. Light usage such as web surfing, writing emails and editing documents in Word or Excel can all still be done comfortably on a machine with an Intel Core 2 processer that is more than 10 years old (at the time of this writing) and running Windows 7. If the components in the computer such as RAM and CPU have been upgraded to their full capacity and other performance improvements such as replacing old hard drives with SSDs are made, such a computer might even be able to run Windows 10 quite acceptably. For example, I have an old Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop which I purchased in 2010. Over the years, I have upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, replaced the CPU with an Intel T9900 and installed an SSD. It is by modern standards still a slow machine however it is able to easily run Windows 10 and works quite well for light usage tasks such as the ones I have mentioned above. Obviously, for heavy tasks such as high-end gaming, video production or 3D animation, it is an obsolete machine however since I don’t do any of these tasks the computer is still of some use to me. Older Pentium based computers dating back to 1993 can probably be considered obsolete since they cannot run any recent versions of Windows regardless of upgrades. However, even so, they can still run operating systems with lighter system requirements such as lightweight Linux distributions. The first PC I ever owned (an Intel 386 machine) is definitely now well and truly obsolete as a computing device.",Quora,Human
Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"Shit yes. My personal computer is obsolete right now.

Maybe you mean, Will local computers become obsolete?

Well, there’s a race going on, between the power of servers on one hand, and the power of desktops and phones on the other hand, and also with the speed of the average network connection.

When servers become much more powerful, computation moves to the server. When data becomes voluminous, computation moves to the local node. It’s been a seesaw battle for maybe 50 years now, with no long-term winner evident.

There will always be some kind of local node, to render the user interface (screen, keyboard, voice, direct neural stimulation, whatever). It seems reasonable that there will always be some kind of server node in the cloud, as long as connections are quick. But the first explorers on Titan will need to take their servers with ‘em, because that 50 minute delay makes games really laggy.",Quora,Human
Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"The computer I’m currently using is not exactly outstanding, but it has 3 screens, with central monitor being 27′’.

I’ve yet to see a laptop or tablet that can do the same thing.

Desktops are not going anywhere in foresseable future, because even if you minituarize electronics, make them smaller, faster, and portable and somehow manage to stuff a petaflop of computing power into a wristwatch… Then it will be always possible to take those electronics, forget about “mobility” and make a stationary installation that will be thousand times more powerful.

And that will be a desktop.

To get red of desktops we would need to redefine concept of computer itself and turn it into something completely different compared to what it currently is.

So, I think the concept of “desktop” will stay with us for at least a century. If not several.",Quora,Human
Will PCs become obsolete in the next decade?,"Computer circuitry has become too integrated into normal domestic appliances and TVs, DVRs, PVRs have all become too computer-smart.

The stand-alone PC may become obsolete, and even the alleged “internet terminal” as it now appears on the TV may also fade away.

As voice recognition improves (and still has a long way to go), people are going to take up Home Automation. I have no problem with a computer controlling air-flow and curtains in order to reduce energy consumption, but I don’t need a system that prepares my meals for me.

This level of integration will very likely make what we recognise right now appear to be obsolete, and the closest to a “terminal” to be seen in the home will be a touch screen accompanied by a voice input. All of these integrations will be consumer-oriented, pumping even more advertising into homes.

The keyboard, mouse, box, and screen, arrangement probably will become obsolete, and the keyboard will be an option entirely for the devout, but now that computers have wormed their way (in multiple numbers) into the majority of homes, even in under-developed countries, regardless of form-factor, they’re here to stay.",Quora,Human
"Overcoming Rejection, When People Hurt You & Life Isn't Fair | TEDxWileyCollege","I've spent 3 years trying to make friends in my community (I moved here about 3 years ago). I have been rejected by every person I'd hoped would become a friend. My last of about a dozen rejections came three weeks ago when my housemate (I live in a roominghouse) told me, ""I could never be friends with you. You're too boring. I can't stand boring people."". This talk made me consider if any of these people would have made good friends if they had accepted me. Probably not. This could be an example of ""Protection by rejection."". I now believe that God has much better friends waiting to meet me somewhere sometime. Thank you for suggesting that possibility.

A (Very Short) Message of Gratitude To My Readers,"It’s been a long while since I signed first signed onto Medium. And it’s been about 5 months since I got serious about it and started publishing relatively regularly (without taking long-ass breaks without warning).

During that relatively short period of time I’ve been consistently overwhelmed by the positive responses I’ve received from my readers.

Grief: What Everyone Should Know | TED,"Only 2 months after my mom died I got the comment ""I'm getting really worried about you"" like I was crazy for still being so upset..( of course from someone who never lost a parent.) I also lost my dad 13 years before my mom died so when my mom died it also brought back the loss of my father because now I lost both parents and I felt so alone. People expect us to just get over it after the funeral.. we never get over it, we just have to move on because that's the only choice we have. I've learned I have to keep my grief to myself for the most part because if you don't people will just think theirs something wrong with you, which is sad. Life is so short and it's scary how fast someone can be here one minute and gone the next so don't take anyone in your life for granted.",Youtube Comments,Human
Grief is Not a Life Sentence | TED,"My husband of 21 years died some 5 months ago. For about 3 months, I wallowed in grief, pain, sadness and loneliness. I searched the internet looking for ways to ""get over it"". I came across Jesse's video and it changed me. For me, the truth of honoring my husband by choosing to live my best life set my path from grieving to healing. Do I still sometimes fall back? You bet I do. It's then I hear my husband's voice telling me pick myself up and get going because this is not how he wants me to live my life. And forward I go. Recently I sold the house we both loved so much because it felt vacant without him. I fell back and fell hard.

"We don't ""move on"" from grief. We move forward with it | TED","I lost my boyfriend almost seven years ago and have yet to be in another relationship.  It took me the first five years of grieving before I was even open to the idea or before I felt like I could sit across from another man without a lump in my throat and wishing that he was someone that is gone forever.  I've struggled with the ""moving on"" aspect and feeling like if I'm able to move on then somehow it's a betrayal to him or meant that I didn't love him as much as I thought I did.  But I appreciate the idea of ""moving forward with him"" and that it doesn't have to be a choice of him vs someone else.  That, because of him, I am who I am now, and the next person to fall in love with me will because of him and what his love and life taught me in many ways.  Anyways, I needed to hear this.",Youtube Comments,Human
Listening to shame | TED,"Cancel culture has existed in Japan since the days of the Samurai, or even earlier. I was the CEO of a company that was taken over by corrupt investors. He forged documents, embezzled large sums of money and embezzled government subsidies. Of course it was against the law. We went to the police, but they didn't want to deal with us.
In Japan, it is difficult to live once you have failed. The whole society, the whole system of the country is a cancel culture.
If I hadn't seen this video, I would have committed suicide. I think the reason why people commit suicide after bankruptcy in Japan is that they have been brainwashed to believe that shame deserves the death penalty.

Listening to shame | TED,"my therapist recommended I go to a self defence class. the lady who happened to teach the self defence class after days of overthinking the reviews, happened to be a social worker. I knew she’d understand why I was terrified to go to a class and I’ve only gone to two and every time I wasn’t going to go I thought to myself “you’re going to be the only one heavily breathing” “look at your body” “they can see right through you, nobody’s going to like you once they know you” “there’s so much people” and somehow a little voice told me today “just go in the building the teacher was really nice last time” and I held onto that and walked in shaking and anxious. After the class I was still shaky and anxious even though the environment was great. The instructor asked to hear my feedback and I told her “I’m scared to say I’ll commit to the class and disappoint you if I’m to anxious to come that day, then I’ll overthink it and stop coming because I feel so guilty” and she recommended your these two Ted talks. And it makes a lot of sense why I struggle so much to find my self love, I feel so much shame that I’m not good enough. I don’t feel worthy of love and at a time I used to. I actually used to think “maybe if I didn’t meet ___”  I would still work out and love myself. But maybe if I just loved myself and wasn’t afraid to be me I would love myself. Idk, just thought I’d share. I’m really happy my instructor asked me to watch this. Thank you",Youtube Comments,Human
The power of vulnerability | TED,"Up until 24 hours ago, before I watched this video I made fun of people who loved so recklessly and willingly gave into the vulnerability in order to experience something beautiful. And I know now that that judgement came from a place of shame. It came from a place that had been hurt and rejected and not chosen multiple times by multiple people. It came from a voice that  told itself to harden and be strong and don't let people in anymore, be you're own happiness, your own love, don't be weak or vulnerable to men because that'll get you hurt. But this Ted Talk changed my life. It changed my perception. And although it took some brutal self analysis and judgement, I instantly felt a sense of relief as she spoke of how it's okay, NECESSARY even to let that in, to live your life with vulnerability  and compassion and boundaries so thank you. You probably saved my life and future college career.

The Unstoppable Power of Letting Go | TEDxWilmingtonWomen,"My ex and I went through a mutual breakup knowing that I deserve better and that “better” wasn’t him. He made the first move to leave and I am still in so much pain from it because I really had high hopes for our relationship but rather, I should feel thankful that he made the first move because if not, I would’ve stayed until I went crazy. I did deserve better, there were more days that I was sad than happy but the few days I was truly happy outweighed the days I was sad because I was blinded by love. I love him, he was good to me and is a great man, but we just weren’t meant to be together in this chapter. Maybe in the future when we’re a better version of ourselves. But if not, I at least know my time wasn’t wasted. He will always have a soft spot in my heart, but where we’re at in life. We’re just not meant to be and that’s okay.
