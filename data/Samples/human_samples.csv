How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"I mean realistically we all knew he was in the Epstein files. 

But all I'm getting out of this is that Elon KNEW he was in the files, yet still happily wore ""Trump was right about everything"" hats and paraded around calling him wonderful and perfect.  He obviously doesn't care about Epstein or pedophiles like he claims, it's all political theatre.

This is as much a self-own as a dig at Trump. He's admitting he knew and just didn't care.  He thinks he's owning Trump, but we all already knew this information.  The only person looking bad person coming off the worst here (edited to fix a bad choice of words, Musk isn't the ONLY one who looks bad) here is Musk for having absolutely no morals and hiding/ignoring the info while Trump was useful to him.

Edit to clarify: Of course Trump looks awful in this as well, and Epstein is obviously a piece of shit. What I mean is that the only truly ""new"" information here is that Musk knew and is telling on himself.",r/AskReddit,Human
How do you feel about Elon Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files?,"There’s already video of Trump being at a party surrounded by women telling a joke to Epstein. We know they were connected. There’s more credible assault allegations against Trump than I can remember. There’s nothing new here. Also, the Epstein “files” are kind of a mythical construct. There’s plenty of real stuff released pertaining to the matter, and plenty more that is probably sealed away for good, but what are the “files” supposed to be, anyway? Like one little black book that just lays out in serial order every client of his and which exact sexual crimes each one committed? I don’t think it works that way.

Bottom line: nothing new here, except it’s very funny to hear Elon admit he spent $300 million to elect a guy he know was a sex criminal, given how quick Elon is to accuse every critic of his of being a pedo",r/AskReddit,Human
"How do you feel about the ""No Kings"" protest happening tomorrow?","The entire time I was growing up (before serving in the military), my father, a Korean War Vet, would make fun of military parades in Russia or China or where ever. He would say, ""Countries that need military parades are pathetic. We don't need military parades because we don't need to show off. That's for dickless authoritarians"". On the occasion of Father's Day weekend, I would love to still have my father alive, but I'm glad he didn't have to see Trump's America. He would be disgusted.",r/AskReddit,Human
"How do you feel about the ""No Kings"" protest happening tomorrow?","It's actually incredible. The protests are not violent. I will bet you cash that your local one is just a lot of ordinary people standing outside together, wanting the best for other people.

I mean, that's what left politics are. We think everyone should have good health care and nice schools and good roads and enough food and feel safe at night. And libraries.

And we think you should have that stuff even if you are poor. Or not white. Or a woman. Or not Christian. Because we think you're a person who is valuable just as you are.",r/AskReddit,Human
I accidentally became my sister’s parent. She just made me a Mother’s Day card.,"I’m 22. My little sister is 7.

Our mom left last year. Said she needed “space” and never came back. Our dad was already in the picture barely once a month.

I was about to start my last year of college. Instead, I became a guardian. Got a second job. Moved us into a tiny studio. I’ve been packing lunches, scheduling dentist appointments, and learning how to braid hair from YouTube.

I haven’t gone out in over a year. I cry in the shower because it’s the only time she can’t hear me. I’m exhausted.

But this morning, she handed me a card with glitter glue and crooked handwriting.

It said: ""Happy Mother's Day. You're my mom now. I love you more than pizza.""

I laughed. I cried. I hugged her for so long she wriggled away.

I don’t know if I’m doing it right. But I’m doing my best.

And I think she sees that.",r/TrueOffMyChest,Human
“I love you?”,"Last night I was trying to get my 7 year old to wash his hands after using the bathroom. I was annoyed he didn’t.

I said, loudly and sternly, “Dude. What do I ALWAYS say?!” Thinking what I always say is “flush and wash your hands every time.” Because I say it. A lot.

My son looked at me for a second thinking and said, “I love you?”

Because that’s probably what I say more than anything else to my kids. It made me genuinely happy that his honest answer to “what does Dad always say” is “I love you.”

I do love you, buddy. Never forget it.

And wash your hands.",r/TrueOffMyChest,Human
